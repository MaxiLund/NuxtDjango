# NuxtDjango
Test Repository to deal with connecting Nuxt as the default frontend of Django. Focus on authentication and database updates. 

Goal:
1. Django REST API Server that can serve one table.
2. The same Django Server will also serve its authentication via REST API.
3. A Nuxt Frontend, that authenticates the user against the Django authentication API.
4. The same nuxt frontend should show a logged-in user the table served via the REST API.
4.1. Optional: Make the same table editable and send the results back to the django REST API.
